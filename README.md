# Mandelbrot Maker

## Ashley Morgan

### Description

This web page creates pictures based on the Mandelbrot set. It is influenced by a very old assignment I did while in computer science, where we had to create a recursive function formula in order to generate a picture, although the code to actual generate the picture was given to us then. So now I want to use typescript, css, and html to create it instead of C++.
